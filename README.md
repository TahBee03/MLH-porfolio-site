# [MLH Fellowship Portfolio Website](https://tdbportfolio-mlh.herokuapp.com/)
**Track:** Production Engineering  
**Pod:** 22.SUM.15  

## Description
Provided a basic Flask web app foundation, PE Fellows were challenged to build portfolio websites to express themselves and talk about their experiences. As we progressed through the fellowship, we learned about and made use of various tools to not only expand the functionality of our websites, but to also monitor the background processes.

## Development Process
1) Created basic web app with Flask, HTML, and CSS
2) Set up DigitalOcean VPS, deployed website with tmux, and defined website subdomain with DuckDNS
3) Deployed website as a service and automated deployment with Bash scripts
4) Established a database for posts using MySQL
5) Created tests to ensure website works as expected before deploying
6) Deployed website within a Docker container and established certificates using NGINX
7) Implemented CI/CD using GitHub Actions and YAML configuration files
8) Configured Prometheus and Grafana containers to monitor website activity
9) Shut down VPS that hosted website, but redeployed website using Heroku
